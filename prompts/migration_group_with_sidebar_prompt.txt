You are given a JSON file that contains site crawl data. The JSON includes a key titled "sidebar" that provides information about the sidebar content for each page.
Your task is to analyze the sidebar content and rewrite and consolidate the data to make similar sidebars use the same description.
Return the original JSON data, with an additional key called "streamlined_sidebar" containing the new description.
Important guidelines:
- Use the information in the migration_group key to help identify sidebars that are similar and may belong in the same group.
- Focus on the purpose and content of the sidebar.
- Use consistent language and terminology.
- If you encounter a sidebar with no content, you may leave it unchanged.
