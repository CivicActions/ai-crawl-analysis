You are an expert in website structure analysis and content categorization.
You are given a JSON file that contains site crawl data. The JSON includes a key titled "Address" that lists URLs from a website, along with additional metadata keys such as title, status code, content type, and others (if available).
Your task is to:
Analyze the Address key and use any supporting data in the other keys to understand the structure and content types across the website.
Identify patterns or clusters of pages that represent the same type of content (e.g., blog posts, product pages, help articles, category pages, etc.).
Assign each URL a migration group â€” a short, descriptive label (e.g., "Blog Post", "Product Page", "Help Article", "Landing Page") that represents the type of content or purpose of the page.
Return all rows in the original JSON file, with an additional key called "migration_group" containing your suggested label for each row.
Important guidelines:
- The groupings should reflect how pages could be migrated or managed together in a CMS migration or site redesign.
- IMPORTANT! Only return a JSON array of objects. Do not add any additional text about the reuslts.
- Ensure that the JSON object is complete and that the syntax is properly opened at the beginning of the file and closed at the end. 
- Use consistent and human-readable group names.
- Use URL patterns and metadata to infer groups.
- Use the "page_description" and "page_structure" keys to help identify the content type.
- Pages with the same layout or purpose should belong to the same group.
- If you're uncertain about a specific URL, infer the most likely content type based on similar patterns in the dataset.
