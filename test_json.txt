Here's some extra text before the JSON starts
Extra text can cause problems with JSON parsing

```json
[
  {
    "address": "https://example.com/page1",
    "migration_group": "Guide Article",
    "page_description": "This is a sample page",
    "sidebar": true
  },
  {
    "address": "https://example.com/page2",
    "migration_group": "Landing Page",
    "page_description": "Another sample page",
    "sidebar": false
  }
]
```

And here's some extra text after the JSON ends which might confuse parsers
